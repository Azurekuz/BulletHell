# BulletHell
Hello. This is the readme file for the Project Bullet Hell Demo. Here is what you need to know.<br />


CONTROLS<br />
The project has two different control schemes:<br />
	&nbsp;Control Scheme A<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrow Keys: Four directional movement<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Z: The player character shoots their attack.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;X: This uses a bomb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and clears the screen of all bullets. Each bullet cleared from onscreen  grants 100 points.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;C and V: Cycle through the three attack types that you’re able to use.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green: This is the spread shot, which is an attack that spreads out in a cone-like pattern. This is the weakest attack out of the three.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue: This is the bounce shot. Whenever it collides with the borders of the screen, it changes trajectory backwards and randomly offsets its &nbsp;an&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically the bullet does a sort of ricochet off the edges of the screen. The middle route in terms of attack strength.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow: The straight shot, simply fires two side-by-side bullets that go straight. The strongest of the three attacks.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;SHIFT: Slows the player down and reveals their small hitbox. Used for minute movement.<br />
	&nbsp;Control Scheme B<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;WASD: Four directional movement.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;J: Attack<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;K: Use a bomb<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;I and O: Cycle through weapons.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;SHIFT: Same as Control Scheme A.<br />
 
GAME GOAL<br />
	&nbsp;You are just a simple wandering soul, flying above a chasm of demonic beings who have come to ruin your day. <br />Your objective is to dodge their attacks and defeat them as you attempt to reach the end of the stage.<br />
Defeating enemies will yield you 100 points, and they’ll drop a small random number of “power items”, which when <br />picked up, strengthen your currently equipped attack type. The strength of your weapon increases for every 10 power it carries. If you, the player, end up losing a life, you also lose half your power and drop them as power items in the location you died.<br />
	&nbsp;If you end up dying or find the enemies’ attacks overwhelming, you can use bombs using X or K and clear all <br />bullets from the screen. The more bullets you clear, the more points you get. You are encouraged to use bombs when you can or really need to. If you die with bombs left, those will go to waste. Luckily, you get three per life.<br />
You can gain lives by accruing certain threshold of points. The initial threshold is 10,000 points. Once you get there, the threshold is doubled to 20,000 (You need a score of 30,000), then 40,000 (You’ll be at 70,000), and so on. You gain points by staying alive, defeating enemies, and clearing bullets off-screen using bombs.<br />
You will need to skillfully maneuver along the screen, power up your attacks, gain lives if you can, and tough it out until the boss at the end of this demo.<br />
